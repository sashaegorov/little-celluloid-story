Meet Celluloid
==============

This is a small story about little `Celluloid` and it's actors and cells. Nothing to tell more in the introduction. Just let's get started.


Just require
------------

As soon as you have made `require 'celluloid/current'` it's already with us.
But before we start playing with it *correct way* let's require deprecated version via `require 'celluloid'` and see what will happen:


```
require 'celluloid'
```

Boom! As result we have got depreciation warning as show:

```
I, [2016-01-19T03:30:06.275244 #36301]  INFO -- : Celluloid 0.17.2 is running in BACKPORTED mode. [ http://git.io/vJf3J ]
```

So please make sure you *don't* require it as `require 'celluloid'` in 2016 year or you have to deal with refactoring your code in near future, for example in 2042. This warning is fully supported by Celluloid version 0.17.2. There is no guarantee it will be the same in future versions, be careful!


Let's take a look on Ruby `Thread.list`:


```
[
    [0] #<Thread:0x007fd0ea8bc3c0 run>
]
```

It seems there is nothing interesting here. Pretty disappointing, right?
Now let's try to do this *correct way* as was told before:


```
require 'celluloid/current'
```

I have to say this is the completely silent thing. It outputs nothing, it just returns `true` as `require` usually does. However, lots of interesting stuff happened under Ruby's hood. Let's check Ruby's `Thread.list` again:


```
[
    [0] #<Thread:0x007fd0ea8bc3c0 run>,
    [1] #<Celluloid::Thread:0x007fd0eca01e40@celluloid-0.17.2/lib/celluloid/group/spawner.rb:47 sleep>,
    [2] #<Celluloid::Thread:0x007fd0eb827580@celluloid-0.17.2/lib/celluloid/group/spawner.rb:47 sleep>,
    [3] #<Celluloid::Thread:0x007fd0eb81fec0@celluloid-0.17.2/lib/celluloid/group/spawner.rb:47 sleep>,
    [4] #<Celluloid::Thread:0x007fd0eb262c58@celluloid-0.17.2/lib/celluloid/group/spawner.rb:47 sleep>
]
```

Can you see what happened? Yes, now we see not only vanilla `<Thread>` object, we can recognize Celluloid's threads denoted by `<Celluloid::Thread>`. This is a very important concept you should understand it very well. _Current Celluloid implementation relies on Ruby's_ `Thread`. Threads behave differently depending on particular Ruby implementation.


This is a good time [to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock) [meet](https://www.igvita.com/2008/11/13/concurrency-is-a-myth-in-ruby/) [Ruby's GIL](http://www.rubyinside.com/does-the-gil-make-your-ruby-code-thread-safe-6051.html) if you are [not](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/8085491-nobody-understands-the-gil). By the way, all these links are different. Take a look on this seasoned articles.


Also, this is the good time to get familiar [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) and
[Rubinius](http://rubinius.com/).
These Ruby implementations have something common â€” they support "true" or native threads.

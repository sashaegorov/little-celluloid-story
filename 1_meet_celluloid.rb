MarkdownLog.h1 'Meet Celluloid'

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
This is a small story about little `Celluloid` and it's actors and cells. \
Nothing to tell more in the introduction. Just let's get started.
P

MarkdownLog.h2 'Just require'

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
As soon as you have made `require 'celluloid/current'` it's already with us.
But before we start playing with it *correct way* let's require deprecated \
version via `require 'celluloid'` and see what will happen:
P

MarkdownLog.code do
  puts "require 'celluloid'"
end

MarkdownLog.p 'Boom! As result we have got depreciation warning as show:'

# Invoke deprecation warning
MarkdownLog.code do
  require 'celluloid'
end

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
So please make sure you *don't* require it as `require 'celluloid'` or you have to deal with refactoring your code in near future. This warning works for Celluloid version #{Celluloid.version}.

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
Let's take a look on Ruby `Thread.list`:
P

MarkdownLog.print Thread.list

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
It seems there is nothing interesting here. Pretty disappointing, right?
Now let's try to do this *correct way* as was told before:
P

MarkdownLog.code "require 'celluloid/current'"
require 'celluloid/current'

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
I have to say this is the completely silent thing. \
It outputs nothing, it just returns `true` as `require` usually does. \
However, lots of interesting stuff happened under Ruby's hood. \
Let's check Ruby's `Thread.list` again:
P

MarkdownLog.print Thread.list

MarkdownLog.p <<-P
Can you see what happened? Yes, now we see not only vanilla `<Thread>` object, we can recognize Celluloid's threads denoted by `<Celluloid::Thread>`. This is a very important concept you should understand it very well. _Celluloid relies on Ruby's `Thread`. Threads behave differently depending on particular Ruby implementation.

Also, this is the good time to get familiar \
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) \
and
[Rubinius](http://rubinius.com/).
These Ruby implementations have something common â€” they support "true" or native threads.
